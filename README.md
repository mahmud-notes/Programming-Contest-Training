# Programming Contest Training
Recently I'm studying the book of Md . Mahbubul hasan which is Programming Contest , Data Structure and Algorithms  . So all of my practiced code will appear in the repository . 

## Timus 1001 - Reverse Root
I've learned some basic things while solving the problem . They may seems very little but was new for me . Those are -
  - About difference between KiloByte and KibiByte
      - 1 kiloByte = 1000 Bytes
      - 1 Kibi Byte = 1024 Bytes 
  - int take 32 bit space - 4 Byte
  - long long take 64 bit space  - 8 Byte
  - float take space same as int - 4 Byte
  - double take space same as long long - 8 Byte
  - About STL Vector , push_back() and iterator
  - EOF (End Of File)
