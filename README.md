Recently I'm studying the book of Md . Mahbubul hasan which is Programming Contest , Data Structure and Algorithms  . So all of my practiced code will appear in the repository . 

## Timus 1000 - A+B Problem


## Timus 1001 - Reverse Root
I've learned some basic things while solving the problem . They may seems very little but was new for me . Those are -
  - About difference between KiloByte and KibiByte
      -1 kiloByte = 1000 Bytes
      -1 Kibi Byte = 1024 Bytes 
  -int take 32 bit space - 4 Byte
  -long long take 64 bit space  - 8 Byte
  -float take space same as int - 4 Byte
  -double take space same as long long - 8 Byte
  -About STL Vector , push_back() and iterator
  -EOF (End Of File)
